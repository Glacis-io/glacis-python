import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install

```bash
pip install glacis
```

## Quick Example

```python
from glacis import Glacis
import os

# Offline mode - works immediately, no API key needed
glacis = Glacis(mode="offline", signing_seed=os.urandom(32))

receipt = glacis.attest(
    service_id="my-ai-app",
    operation_type="inference",
    input={"prompt": "..."},   # Hashed locally, never sent
    output={"response": "..."}, # Hashed locally, never sent
)

print(receipt.id)              # oatt_xxx...
print(receipt.witness_status)  # UNVERIFIED
```

## What Gets Sent?

| Data | Transmitted? |
|------|--------------|
| Your prompts | No -- SHA-256 hash only |
| Model outputs | No -- SHA-256 hash only |
| API keys | No |
| Timestamps | Yes |
| Service ID | Yes |

Your sensitive data stays local. Only cryptographic commitments are transmitted for witnessing.

  <Card title="Zero-Egress" icon="lock">
    Payloads are hashed locally using SHA-256. Only the hash is transmitted -- your data never leaves your environment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offline Mode" icon="laptop">
    Works immediately without an API key. Receipts are self-signed with Ed25519 and marked "UNVERIFIED".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider Integrations" icon="puzzle">
    Auto-attesting wrappers for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. Every API call is automatically attested.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verifiable" icon="approve-check">
    Receipts can be independently verified. Online mode adds Merkle proofs and a transparency log.

## Offline vs Online Mode

| Feature | Offline | Online |
|---------|---------|--------|
| API key required | No | Yes |
| Signing | Local Ed25519 | Glacis witness |
| Merkle proofs | No | Yes |
| Verification URL | No | Yes |
| Witness status | UNVERIFIED | WITNESSED |

Start with offline mode for development. Upgrade to online when you need third-party verifiability for audits, papers, or customer due diligence.
